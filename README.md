angular-chat
============

I did this chatroom app project to learn angular front end framework and django-rest framework.

This is a backend independent angular app. Requires a REST backend. One implemented with django-rest included, but it is easy to set-up backend with any REST capable web server.

If you are familiar with both frameworks, code structure is pretty simple and self-explaining and easy to set-up.

If not familiar, I suggest you do first excellent angular tutorial. Django has also great tutorials available.

I became Angular fan through this project. I had use jQuery extensively before and Angular brings great structure to the front end.

Sorry, I had issues with Karma set up in my Mac so module tests are missing.
